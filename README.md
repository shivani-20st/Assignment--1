# Insurance Claims Management System

This is a simple Flask web application to manage insurance policyholders and their claims. It uses a JSON file for data storage and provides reports for claim analysis and risk assessment. The app also uses **ngrok** to expose the local server to the internet, so you can access it remotely.


## Features

* Register new policyholders with name, age, policy type, and sum insured.
* Add insurance claims linked to registered policyholders.
* View list of all policyholders and their claim details.
* Generate reports like high-risk policyholders, claim frequencies, average claim amounts by policy type, pending claims, and more.
* Access your app from anywhere using ngrok's public URL.


## How to Run

1. **Install required packages** (if not installed):

   ```bash
   pip install flask pyngrok
   ```

2. **Set up your ngrok auth token**:

   Replace the placeholder `"YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN"` in the code with your actual ngrok token from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).

3. **Run the Flask app**:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

4. When the server starts, you will see a public URL generated by ngrok printed in the console. Use that URL to access your app remotely.



## How to Use the App

* **Home Page:** Quick links to register policyholders, add claims, view reports, and see all policyholders.
* **Register Policyholder:** Fill in details and save a new policyholder.
* **Add Claim:** Input claim details associated with a policyholder ID.
* **View Policyholders:** See all registered policyholders and access their detailed info and claims.
* **Reports:** Check high-risk policyholders, claim stats, monthly claims, average claim amounts, highest claims, and pending claims.



## Data Persistence

All data is saved in a local `data.json` file, so your data remains intact between restarts.



## Notes

* Make sure your dates are in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* Policyholder IDs are automatically generated.
* Claim statuses default to "Pending".
* The system uses Bootstrap for a clean UI.
