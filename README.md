# Insurance Claims Management System

This is a Flask web application to manage insurance policyholders and their claims. It uses a JSON file for data storage and provides reports for claim analysis and risk assessment. The app also uses **ngrok** to expose the local server to the internet, so you can access it remotely.

## Features

* Register new policyholders with name, age, policy type, and sum insured.
* Add insurance claims linked to registered policyholders.
* View list of all policyholders and their claim details.
* Generate reports like high-risk policyholders, claim frequencies, average claim amounts by policy type, pending claims, and more.
* Access your app from anywhere using ngrok's public URL.


## How to Run

1. **Install required packages** (if not installed):

   ```bash
   pip install flask pyngrok
   ```

2. **Set up your ngrok auth token**:

   Replace the placeholder `"YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN"` in the code with your actual ngrok token from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).

3. **Run the Flask app**:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

4. When the server starts, you will see a public URL generated by ngrok printed in the console. Use that URL to access your app remotely.

## Important Limitation
This app is designed to run on environments like Google Colab or any online server where the Python process stays active and connected to the internet. If you close the Colab notebook or disconnect the runtime, the server and the ngrok tunnel will stop working.
So, you need to keep your Colab session active and connected for the app to be accessible through the ngrok public URL. If your session disconnects, you will lose access until you restart the app and get a new ngrok URL.

## How to Use the App

* **Home Page:** Quick links to register policyholders, add claims, view reports, and see all policyholders.
* **Register Policyholder:** Fill in details and save a new policyholder.
* **Add Claim:** Input claim details associated with a policyholder ID.
* **View Policyholders:** See all registered policyholders and access their detailed info and claims.
* **Reports:** Check high-risk policyholders, claim stats, monthly claims, average claim amounts, highest claims, and pending claims.



## Data Persistence

All data is saved in a local `data.json` file, so your data remains intact between restarts.



## Notes

* Make sure your dates are in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* Policyholder IDs are automatically generated.
* Claim statuses default to "Pending".
* The system uses Bootstrap for a clean UI.
